  This project started by trying to go through each section and me changing what I needed to change starting with the header. With this i just had to center the text and remove the default margin and padding so that the background color expands to the width of the screen. Then I had to add some padding to all of the body text. The most difficult part of the project was figuring out how to get the quiz section right. I eventually added an extra div so that I could format the picture to be on the right and I added margin and padding to all of the sections to make the divs positioned correctly. And for the most part, I didn't really veer too far from the original webpage, so it should look pretty similar to the original in most places.
